abstract: AThe accurate prediction of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation and glioma segmentation are important tasks for computer-aided diagnosis using preoperative multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The two tasks are ongoing challenges due to the significant inter-tumor and intra-tumor heterogeneity. The existing methods to address them are mostly based on single-task approaches without considering the correlation between the two tasks. In addition, the acquisition of IDH genetic labels is expensive and costly, resulting in a limited number of IDH mutation data for modeling. To comprehensively address these problems, we propose a fully automated multimodal MRI-based multi-task learning framework for simultaneous glioma segmentation and IDH genotyping. Specifically, the task correlation and heterogeneity are tackled with a hybrid CNN-Transformer encoder that consists of a convolutional â€¦
