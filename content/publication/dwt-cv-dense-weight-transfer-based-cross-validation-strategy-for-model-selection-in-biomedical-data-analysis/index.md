abstract: Model selection for deep learning algorithms is an extremely important
  step in the process of extracting knowledge from limited data, especially in
  biomedical data. The common approach is to adopt cross-validation techniques
  to randomly divide a small subset of the training set as the validation data
  for parameter tuning and model selection. However, this method may choose a
  sub-optimal model due to insufficient data utilization, and the process, such
  as -fold cross-validation, is cumbersome and time-consuming. In this study, we
  propose a dense weight transfer-based cross validation (DWT-CV) strategy for
  biomedical data analysis and use this strategy to improve the generalization
  of deep learning algorithms with reduced training time using weight transfer
  learning. DWT-CV utilizes a dense weight aggregation and weight transfer
  mechanism to make the model more general and converge faster during the cross
  validation. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is evaluated on
  multiple experiments with three different domains including biomedical image
  classification, drugâ€“target affinity prediction, and medical image
  segmentation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed
  DWT-CV strategy can make several deep learning benchmark methods perform
  better on multiple biomedical datasets, which implies that it may be an
  alternative to the traditional cross validation criterion for model selection.
