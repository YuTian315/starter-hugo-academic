abstract: The accurate prediction of glioma grade is essential for treatment planning and prognosis. In this study, we proposed a novel radiomics-based pipeline by incorporating the intratumoral and peritumoral features extracted from preoperative mpMRI scans to accurately and noninvasively predict glioma grade. To address the unclear peritumoral boundary, we designed an algorithm to capture the peritumoral region with a specified radius. The mpMRI scans of 285 patients derived from a multi-institutional study were adopted. A total of 2153 radiomic features were calculated separately from intratumoral volumes (ITVs) and peritumoral volumes (PTVs) on mpMRI scans, and then refined using LASSO and mRMR feature ranking methods. The top-ranking radiomic features were entered into the classifiers to build radiomic signatures for predicting glioma grade. The prediction performance was evaluated with five-fold cross â€¦
