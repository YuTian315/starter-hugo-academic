Data Preprocessing: Preprocessing data of three modal of Magnetic Resonance, including fMRI, sMRI and DTI. We use the cloud storage system to allow you submitting before processing data on cloud device.

Network Analysis: This tool can calculate the attributes of network such as rich-club coefficient, and then take advantage of various chart, some graph build with d3.js, to demonstrate them.

3D Visualize: In this tool, it can visualize functional networks of brain by more intuitive way, showing connection weight between ROI(Region-of-interest) in 3D Space.

Diffusion Weighted Imaging: Based on ray casting, one of ways to reconstruct 3d images, It could transform image data in nifti format into visible object in 3D Space.
